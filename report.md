# Integration Testing with spring framework

## Firstly, a gradle project should be created

## Then to use spring plugins should be added to build.gradle file to use spring framework

## After successfully adding spring, we can write tests for integration testing of APIs

## Afterwards we should run testing class (IntegrationTesting in my case). If we get BUILD SUCCESSFUL it means it is ready to push to github

## To create automatic workflow when making pull request we should have .github/workflows/gradle.yml file

## After configuring .github/workflows/gradle.yml file to create github actions it remains to push project to github and make pull request from feature/lab5 to develop
